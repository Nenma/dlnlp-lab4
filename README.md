# Deep Learning applied in NLP - Laboratory 4

## Task description

BLEU, or the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, is a score for comparing a candidate translation
of text to one or more reference translations. Implement a program which evaluates a
machine translation.

Steps:

1. For two user typed sentence in Romanian, of at least 10 words, use a freely
   available translation API to translate it into English. You need the correct translations
   also, so ask the user to validate/enter the correct translation.
2. Compute precision/recall/f-measure for the machine translations.
3. Implement a function able to compute the BLEU score for the sentence
   pairs.
